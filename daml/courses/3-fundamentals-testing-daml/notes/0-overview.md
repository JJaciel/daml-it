# Overview

This is the 3rd and final course in the Daml Fundamentals certification path, which leads to a foundational-level certification exam and capstone project. The Daml Fundamentals certification path prepares a developer to build a simple Daml application through learning the basics of Daml programming and testing. The Daml Fundamentals certification path consists of three courses: Functional Programming in Daml, Canton Ledger Programming in Daml, and Testing in Daml.

This course should take approximately 3 hours to complete, and covers the following topics:
How to reason about testing Daml code
How to leverage Navigator for testing and debugging
How to design test scripts
How to use debug, trace, assert, abort, ensure, and handle exceptions
