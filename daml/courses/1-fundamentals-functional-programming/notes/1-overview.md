# Course Overview
This is the first course in the Daml Fundamentals certification path, which leads to a foundational-level certification exam and capstone project. The Daml Fundamentals certification path prepares a developer to build a simple Daml application through learning the basics of Daml programming and testing. The Daml Fundamentals certification path consists of three courses: Functional Programming in Daml, Canton Ledger Programming in Daml, and Testing in Daml.

This course should take approximately 4 hours to complete, and covers the following topics:
What makes Daml unique
How to reason about functional programming and why it is important for creating applications in Daml
SDK setup and configuration
