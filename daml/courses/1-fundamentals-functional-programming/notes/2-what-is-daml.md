# What is Daml
Functional programming in Daml
Daml is a smart contract language designed to build composable applications on the Daml Ledger Model
*Three fundational concepts:*
## Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are *Software that combines protocols, user interfaces, and promises expressed via those interfaces to formalize and secure relationships over public networks.*
Also are
- Are Applications
- Transactions are *Atomic*, meaning that it completely *success* or completely *fails*
- Are immutable
## Composable Applications
Generic term used to indicate developing something from smaller parts.
These parts can be:
- workflows
- microservices
- architectural networks
- architectural domains

The key idea is that Daml allows the application layer to be completely abstracted from the other layers, thereby making them composable and reusable.

## Daml Ledger Model
The Daml Ledger Model is a record of transactions that are executed as part of a workflow.
The ledger is shared accross multiple that engage in a contractual relationship modeled in Daml.
