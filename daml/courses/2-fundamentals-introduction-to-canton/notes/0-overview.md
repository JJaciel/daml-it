# Overview: Course 2
This is the 2nd course in the Daml Fundamentals certification path, which leads to a foundational-level certification exam and capstone project. The Daml Fundamentals certification path prepares a developer to build a simple Daml application through learning the basics of Daml programming and testing. The Daml Fundamentals certification path consists of three courses: Functional Programming in Daml, Canton Ledger Programming in Daml, and Testing in Daml.

This course should take approximately 3 hours to complete, and covers the following topics:
How to reason about the Canton ledger model and its components
How to write and test templates
How to identify and retrieve contracts
Transaction trees
Functor, applicative, and action
Actions and loops
Prerequisites: 
1. Successful completion of the Functional Programming in Daml course.
2. Basic understanding of the Daml value proposition.
3. Familiarity with Daml use cases.
4. Basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables, data-types, expressions, conditions, and iterations.
5. Experience leveraging programming languages and frameworks to build production applications in a professional environment.
